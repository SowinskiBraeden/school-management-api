# Testing

Hello there! If you are in this part of the codespace, I have cleaned it up compared to the 
original codespace. The algorithms have been moved out of `tinker.py` into their own python  
script from version 1 to 3. These are in the `/scheduleGenerator` folder. I suggest to look  
at the latest work in `v3.py` where the algorithm has come a long way. Using real 2018 course  
selection data from my school I am able to test the script to its full potential compared to  
V1 and V2.

V3 has a entirely different approach from V1 and V2, that you can read about at the top of  
the function in `v3.py`. The function is broken up into 6 steps, each step is labeled within  
the function with a comment, giving a brief explination of what that step contributes to the  
algorithm.
